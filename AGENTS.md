# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v2 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when the task touches Agents application behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release metadata, app-owned capabilities, packaging, or deployment. Agent runtime SPI and persistence are owned by `../sdkwork-kernel/`.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: repository agent entrypoint and relative SDKWork spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`: compatibility shims that point to `AGENTS.md`.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: Agents application identity and capability metadata.
- `sdkwork.workflow.json`: GitHub packaging/release workflow manifest governed by `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- `.github/workflows/package.yml`: thin reusable workflow call only.
- `.sdkwork/`: repository/application AI workspace metadata.
- `specs/`: local application/component contracts.
- `apis/`, `apps/`, `crates/`, `sdks/`, `database/`, `configs/`, `deployments/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, `tests/`.
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`: language/build manifests.

## Documentation Canon

- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
- [docs/product/prd/PRD.md](docs/product/prd/PRD.md)
- [docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Spec Resolution Order

Use dynamic progressive loading:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when app behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release, packaging, or app-owned capabilities are touched.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` only when the task touches that local contract.
4. Read `../sdkwork-kernel/specs/README.md` when agent kernel SPI boundaries are touched.
5. Read `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`, then only the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files after the dictionary and relevant specs are clear.

Do not load the whole repository or every root spec before identifying the task surface.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Package script changes: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- Rust code: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`; add `../sdkwork-kernel/specs/AGENT_KERNEL_SPEC.md` for agent SPI work.
- API/SDK changes: `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md`.
- Database changes: `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`.
- File upload: `../sdkwork-specs/DRIVE_SPEC.md` — must use sdkwork-drive Drive Uploader.
- Runtime/deployment/release: `../sdkwork-specs/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load Rust, Java, TypeScript, and frontend specs for unrelated tasks.

## Code Style Rules

Read `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes. Use `sdkwork-utils-rust` for shared helpers. Do not duplicate kernel agent runtime logic in this repository.

## Build, Test, and Verification

Use canonical root package scripts from `PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`:

```powershell
pnpm verify
pnpm check
pnpm topology:validate
pnpm db:validate
```

## Agent Execution Rules

Do not rely on memory when a relevant SDKWork spec exists. Do not replace generated SDK calls with raw HTTP. Stop when kernel ownership, API authority, or SDK family boundaries are ambiguous.

## Human Review Rules

Human review is required for breaking public API changes, schema migrations, security exceptions, kernel dependency boundary changes, and generated SDK ownership changes.
